== Description ==

A call to action widget essentially displays a title, subtitle and a button on your page. This is great for placing more emphasis on the action than a standard button would.

You can add this widget to your standard widgetized areas and [Page Builder](http://wordpress.org/plugins/siteorigin-panels/) pages.
