== Description ==

A simple slider widget that lets you add sliders to your sidebars and [Page Builder](http://wordpress.org/plugins/siteorigin-panels/) pages.

It works with the simple idea of having a slide with a background and an overlay image that's placed on top. This allows you to have a responsive slider that scales to fit its container while keeping any text crisp and sharp.

For a better idea of how to use the slider widget, read the [documentation](http://siteorigin.com/slider-widget-documentation/) over on SiteOrigin. If you need a more advanced slider, we recommend [Meta Slider](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ml-slider/).
